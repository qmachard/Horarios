# Horarios
Never missed its transport.

## What is that ?
Horarios is a web-based application AngularJS to display the next passage in his bus, tram, metro, etc.
The application is, for now, based on the Tan's API (Nantes). Fork me, if you whant more services. :D

## How to install

### Requierements

Horarios is based on __[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)__. It requires [__NPM__](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [__Compass__](http://compass-style.org/)

### Installation

To load the libraries and dependencies Angular launch this command in the root directory :
```

To load the CSS with Compass, place yourself in __app/__ and run:

You can then start the application, and add it to the home screen of your Smartphone or Tablet
